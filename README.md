# GES Form Automation
A small Google Script automation that fills and submits Google Forms responses from a Google Sheets document

### About
Ghana Education Service recently requested that basic school teachers fill and submit individual Google forms for each pupil in their class.
I found that having to repeatedly fill the forms with only a few variable data was too time consuming and prone to issues, especially for less computer literate teachers. With the script, all that has to be done is to fill in the variable data and click submit.

The link below will direct you to a Google Sheets file with sample data and a button to run the automation script.

Authorization may be required to run the script for the first time.

In order not to spam the GES with false data while working on the script I replicated the original form for testing. With the link provided below the test form's responses can be viewed.

Once the "Click to submit" button is pressed in Google Sheets, the Google Forms are automatically filled and the responses are generated.
